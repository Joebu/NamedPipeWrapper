		<Description>Create named pipe servers that can handle multiple client connections simultaneously.

Send strongly-typed messages between clients and servers: any serializable .NET object can be sent over a pipe and will be automatically serialized/deserialized, including cyclical references and complex object graphs.

Messages are sent and received asynchronously on a separate background thread and marshalled back to the calling thread (typically the UI).

Supports large messages - up to 300 MiB.

The package was forked from NamedPipeWrapper 1.4.0 creadted by Andrew C. Dvorak and the original project url is https://github.com/acdvorak/named-pipe-wrapper.</Description>
